    <h1>The Order: 1886 Full Narrative Review</h1>
    <img class="cover" src="../Picture/the-order-1886.jpg" alt="The Order: 1886 cover"/>
    When I first started playing **The Order: 1886** (Release date: 2015-01-13, developer: Unknown Studio), it felt like I suddenly jumped into a whole new world. Right from the start it was super exciting, and I couldn’t wait to see what the game had in store for me.

The gameplay kept surprising me. Sometimes everything went smoothly, but other times it was so hard that I almost wanted to rage quit. But that’s what made it fun: when I finally got through a tough part, I felt so proud of myself, like I was a real hero. The sounds, graphics, and controls were often really cool, but sometimes a bit weird too.

I tried looking for cheat codes, but sadly I couldn’t find any. It would be awesome to have one that makes me invincible, or helps me escape from enemies more easily! :)

Exploring the maps was always fun: hidden spots, surprises, and lots of funny moments. But the best part was when I played multiplayer with my friends. Sometimes we messed up and laughed like crazy, other times we played like a real team, and in those moments I honestly felt like we were the best players in the world!

Of course, not everything was perfect. Sometimes the graphics looked a little blurry, or the maps felt repetitive and boring. Other times the sound effects didn’t feel real, more like plastic. These things bugged me a bit, but they never stopped me from playing, because I was always excited to see what would happen next.

Overall, I think **The Order: 1886** is a super cool game! Whether I played alone or with friends, it always stayed exciting. I’m definitely going to play it again, because it just gave me too many awesome memories.
